## The Aim

A comprehensive experience when using [Facebook's Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) within a project.

* Useful IDE based Feedback
* Session based test watching

## Maintainers

Orta Therox ([@orta](https://github.com/orta)), Sean Poulter ([@seanpoulter](https://github.com/seanpoulter)), Vincent Voyer ([@vvo](https://github.com/vvo)) & ConnectDotz ([@connectdotz](https://github.com/connectdotz)).

## Features

* Starts Jest automatically when you're in a root folder project with Jest installed.
* Show individual fail / passes inline.
* Show fails inside the problem inspector.
* Highlights the errors next to the `expect` functions.
* Adds syntax highlighting to snapshot files.
* A one button update for failed snapshots.
* Show coverage information in files being tested. 
* Help debug jest tests in vscode.

## How to get it?

Simply open [Jest - Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Orta.vscode-jest) and click "Install".
Alternatively open Visual Studio Code, go to the extension view and search for "Jest".
 
For detailed releases and migration help, please see [releases](https://github.com/jest-community/vscode-jest/releases).

## How to get it set up?

This extension runs on top of your Jest installation. Upon starting, it has the expectation that the Jest environment is properly set up, i.e. jest can be executed in VS Code's terminal.

Out of the box, this extension should work for most simple/standard jest and react projects. However, if you have a more sophisticated project or custom jest command, the default configuration most likely won't be sufficient but you can easily customize it with various settings<sup>*</sup>, such as `jest.pathToJest` where you can specify how you usually run your jest tests. 

If you encountered any difficulty or have suggestions, please do not hesitate to [ask](https://github.com/jest-community/vscode-jest/issues), we have an active community that you might find helpful. 

_*: all settings in this extension are prefixed with `jest`_

## How to start Jest?

The extension will start Jest for you when:

* we find Jest configuration files in the workspace: `jest.config.js` or `jest.json`
* we find Jest installed in the workspace: `node_modules/.bin/jest`
* we find the workspace has been bootstrapped with create-react-app: `node_modules/react-scripts/node_modules/.bin/jest`
  - `node_modules/react-native-scripts`
* you run the **Jest: Start Runner** command


## How do I debug tests?

The simplest use cases should be supported out-of-the-box, but at the latest when VS Code displays errors about the attribute `program` or `runtimeExecutable` not being available, you have to create your own debug configuration within `launch.json`.

This plugin provides blueprints for debugging plain Jest setups or projects bootstrapped by `create-react-app`. (In the latter case you may have to edit the `runtimeExecutable` to reflect the used `react-scripts` package.) If those don't match your setup, you can modify the blueprints or create a completely new debug configuration, but keep in mind, that the `type` has to be `node` and that the configuration has to be named `"vscode-jest-tests"`. In order to learn more about debug/launch configurations in general, visit [VS Code Docs: Debugging](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_launch-configurations).

Starting with debugging is possible by clicking on the `debug` CodeLense above appendant `it` tests, but you can also debug all tests at once by starting debugging of `"vscode-jest-tests"` within the VS Code Debug Side Bar.

### Notes for troubleshooting

In contrast to previous versions of this plugin the debug settings are now independent from VS Code's `jest.pathToJest` and `jest.pathToConfig` setting. If you had to modify one of these, you pretty surely have to create a custom debug configuration and modify its path. This especially includes cases, in which `jest` isn't at its default location.


## How do I show code coverage?

Starting from [v3.1](https://github.com/jest-community/vscode-jest/releases/tag/v3.1.0), code coverage can be easily turned on/off at runtime without customization. 

To toggle the coverage mode: go to [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) and select **Jest: Toggle Coverage Overlay** command. (TODO: toggle from StatusBar, PR welcome)

The coverage mode, along with watch mode, are shown in StatusBar:

![status-bar-modes](https://github.com/jest-community/vscode-jest/raw/master/images/status-bar-modes.png)

_(The initial coverage mode is `off` but can be changed by adding `"jest.showCoverageOnLoad": true` in settings.)_ 

<!--
### TODO: Change overlay format
Use a setting that's one of "", "", etc.
```json
{
    "jest.?": ""
}
```

## Inspiration

I'd like to give a shout out to [Wallaby.js](https://wallabyjs.com), which is a significantly more comprehensive and covers a lot more editors, if this extension interests you - check out that too.


## Wanted

Someone to take responsibility for ensuring that the default setup for create-react-app is always working. All the current authors use TypeScript and React/React Native and so have very little familiarity with changes to CRA. _Apply via PRs :D_.


## Troubleshooting

### start jest from non-root folder
If you don't use the root of your project for your JS with Jest tests, do not worry, you can still use this project. You will need to use the "Start Jest Runner" command, and maybe have to configure your own `jest.pathToJest` setting inside the `.vscode/settings.json` to whatever you would use.

These are the [activation events](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/activation-events) which trigger the runner to start:

```json
  "activationEvents": [
    "workspaceContains:node_modules/.bin/jest",
    "workspaceContains:node_modules/react-scripts/node_modules/.bin/jest",
    "workspaceContains:node_modules/react-native-scripts",
    "onCommand:io.orta.jest.start"
  ],
```

These are the things that will trigger the extension loading. If one of these applies, and you're not seeing the "Jest" in the bottom bar, reference the self-diagnosis below

### use extension in multiroot environment
vscode-jest supports multiroot feature, but if you want to turn it off for some workspace folders check out `jest.disabledWorkspaceFolders` configuration setting.
`jest.disabledWorkspaceFolders` is an array of strings with folder names.

### non-standard environments
vscode-jest supports common jest configuration, such as when jest is in `root/node_modules/.bin/jest`, or for react-native `root/node_modules/react-native-scripts`. 

However, if your repo doesn't fall into these patterns or you want to pass extra parameters, you can easily use the `jest.pathToJest` or `jest.pathToConfig` settings to instruct the plugin on how to start jest. You can even use the scripts from package.json, such as `npm run test --` or `yarn test`. Feel free to experiment and search the issues for many examples.

### plugin not running as expect? try self-diagnosis
If your can execute jest tests on command line but vscode-jest was not running as expected, here is what you can do to find out what it is actually doing:
1. click on `Jest:stopped` on status bar to show Jest Output window: 
   <img src="https://github.com/jest-community/vscode-jest/raw/master/images/output-channel.png" alt="Screenshot of the tool" width="100%">
1. turn on the debug mode: set `"jest.debugMode": true` in `.vscode/settings.json` 
1. restart vscode-jest or reload the window (via `Reload Window` command)
1. open the developer tool (via `Help > Toggle Developer Tools` menu), you should see more information including how we extract jest config and spawn jest processes.

Hopefully most issues would be pretty obvious after seeing these extra output, and you can probably fix most yourself by customizing the `jest.pathToJest` and other settings.
