# Extension Setup Wizard (Beta) <!-- omit in toc -->


This is an interactive tool to help users set up vscode-jest extension if the default configuration is not sufficient. 

_(The setup wizard is released as a beta product in v4. Thank you for trying it out! üëç  Please don't hesitate to make suggestion or file issues so we can quickly improve and make it more useful for the community.)_

## Overview

It helps users to set up the essential configurations of the extension via a simple UI. While the extension provides default configurations that work for the common standard environments, such as CRA and plain jest, the more sophisticated projects might need to customize the extension via a few simple settings that the wizard will help walking through this process. 

The wizard asks questions and collects answers to update `settings.json` and `launch.json` in user's workspace ( [How does it work ?](#how-does-it-work)). It works for both single and multi-root workspaces. An OUTPUT channel `"vscode-jest Setup"` will be presented to show progress and tips through out the process. 

Users can run the wizard any time ([How to run it ?](how-to-run-it)) and safely abort if desired. 

The wizard tries its best to create accurate configurations but it will not be able to cover all the use cases out there. However, it always strikes for transparency, and shows where and what the configuration will be updated so users can easily modify it later manually if needed.

_(Note: the wizard is not to set up [jest](https://jestjs.io) itself. Actually, a working jest environment (such that you can run jest tests in terminal) is a prerequisite of running `vscode-jest` extension.)_
## How to run it
in v4.0, there are multiple ways you can activate the setup wizard

1. via [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette): one can launch the wizard on-demand via vscode command palette `"Jest: Setup Extension"` 
2. via the setup button in various message panels, such as when jest process failed to start or when detecting missing debug config.

## How does it work 
The wizard provides 2 main setup tasks:
1. [jest command line](#jest-command-line): used by the extension to kick off jest test run on behave of users. 
2. [vscode debug config](#debug-config): to enable debugging individual jest test via the debug codeLens.
   
The wizard setup is workspace bound. For multi-root projects, user will be prompt to select a workspace folder to work with.

### Jest command line
The extension start jest tests process on behave of the users by issuing the same test command they otherwise run in terminal. Therefore it needs to know the command to start jest process. The wizard will examine the existing settings, looking for `"jest.jestCommandLine"` or the deprecated `"jest.pathToJest"` and `"jest.pathToConfig"`. If found, it will let users to [migrate](#note-1)/edit it; if not found, it will ask user to manually input the command line.

Please be aware that all relative paths in the settings are resolved against the `rootPath`, which by default is the current workspace folder unless you customize it with `"jest.rootPath"`.


While users can pass any jest CLI options in the `"jest.jestCommandLine"`, it is recommended NOT to pass the following:
- the watch options (--watch, --watchAll): the extension will append watch flag when appropriate. 
- the coverage option (--coverage): user can easily toggle on/off coverage via command so no need to add it on the commandLine.

Because the extension appends additional options to this commandLine at run time, please make sure these additional options can be passed through, for example, if your command-line is `"npm test"`, make sure you add `"--"` at the end to pass through the additional options: `"npm test --"`

**Please note, `"jest.jestCommandLine"` setting is required to configure the debug config below.**

### Debug Config
When clicked on the debug codeLens, the extension will look for a debug config named `"vscode-jest-tests"`, and append the additional arguments (such as `--testNamePattern`) when launching the debugger.

If there is no existing `"jest.jestCommandLine"`, it will suggest to set one up before proceed, after all, a working jest environment is the prerequisite of this extension.

The wizard will examine the `launch.json` for existing config. If found, users can choose to use it as it is, replace (rename the old one and generate a new one) or manually editing it; if not found, wizard will try to [generate](#note-2) a new one. 

The debug config is saved in `launch.json` in workspace folder and shown at the end of the setup for review or adjustment. If the user chooses to "replace" the existing config, the old configure will be renamed to `vscode-jest-tests-xxxxx` for reference purpose only, which can be safely deleted if not needed.

The generated config probably work fine for most projects, but could require further adjustment for projects including but not limited to the following:
- projects use different jest config between debug and regular test run
- projects with [platform specific properties](#note-3).

## FAQ

- <a id="note-1">**What does jestCommandLine migration process do?**</a> 

  The wizard will combine `jest.PathToJest` and `jest.pathToConfig` into a single command line `jest.jestCommandLine` , e.g. 
  ```
  //example 1
  jest.PathToJest = 'yarn test'
  jest.PathToConfig = '../../shared-jest.json'
  ==> jest.jestCommandLine = 'yarn test --config ../../shared-jest.json' 


  // example 2
  jest.PathToJest = '../../node_modules/.bin/jest '
  jest.PathToConfig = './jest-config.json'
  ==> jest.jestCommandLine = '../../node_modules/.bin/jest --config ./jest-config.json' 
  ```

  The `jest.jestCommandLine` setting will be saved in the workspace folder's local "settings.json" file.

- <a id="note-2">**How is debug config generated?**</a>
  The process goes like this:
  - parse `jest.jestCommandLine` into command and arguments. Resolve relative command path based on `jest.rootPath` if defined otherwise uses vscode variable `"${workspaceFolder}"`.
  - obtain a debug template from `DebugConfigurationProvider`
  - merge the jest command and arguments with the template.
    - if the command is `npm` or `yarn` it updates `runtimeExecutable` property; otherwise updates `program`
    - the arguments will be added to the `args` property, plus jest debug specific flags such as `--runInBand`.
  - update `cwd` property with either `jest.rootPath` if defined, otherwise the vscode variable `"${workspaceFolder}"`

  
- <a id="note-3">**How is platform specific properties handled in DebugConfig generation?**</a>
  
  Currently the wizard does not generate platform specific properties. Users will need to manually maintain them in `lauch.json` file. 

  For example, for a different jest command under windows, add the `windows.program` section in `launch.json`:

  ```
  // launch.json
  "configurations": [
    ...
     {
       type: "node",
       name: "vscode-jest-tests",
       ...
       program = "${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/.bin/jest",
       windows = {
         program: '${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/jest/bin/jest',
       },
     },
  ]
  ```
  See more details and examples in [vscode: platform specific properties](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_platformspecific-properties).
    

- <a id="note-4">**vscode-jest debug codeLens failed, now what?**</a>
  
  If your regular jest run was fine but you can't debug the test with debug codeLens after running wizard. There should be some error message in your terminal that might help you pinpoint the culprit. 

  There are many information online about how to setup vscode debug config for specific environments/frameworks, you might find the following helpful:
  - [vscode debug config properties](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-debugging#_launch-configuration-properties) 
  - [Launch configurations for common scenarios](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-debugging#_launch-configurations-for-common-scenarios)
  - [vscode-recipes for debug jest tests](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-recipes/tree/master/debugging-jest-tests)
  
  While you can manually correct the debug config and move on, if you think your use case is actually quite common, feel free to create a discussion/issue so we might be able to enhance the wizard or include your example config to help others.
