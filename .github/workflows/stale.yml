            It will be automatically closed in 30 days if no further activity occurs.

  # Job: mark-legacy-issue
  # Summary:
  #   Uses the stale action (with ignore-updates: true so that the decision is based
  #   solely on the creation date) to mark open issues as "legacy" if they were
  #   created over 2 years (730 days) ago, provided they do not carry exempt labels such as "pinned",
  #   "security". A message is posted recommending that users open a new issue if the
  #   problem persists.
